<h2 style="color: green;">Postpartum complications: What you need to know</h2>
<p style="text-align:left; font-size:1.1em;">After childbirth, you're likely focused on caring for your baby. But health problems, 
<br>some life-threatening, can happen in the weeks and months afterward and many aren't 
<br>aware of the warning signs. Here's what you need to know about postpartum complications.</p>

<h2 style="color: green;">A growing problem</h2>
<p style="text-align:left; font-size:1.1em;">A pregnancy-related death is the death of a woman while pregnant or within one year of the end 
<br>of a pregnancy. More than half the pregnancy-related deaths happen after childbirth.</p>
<p> According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the number of reported pregnancy-related deaths 
<br>in the United States in 2014 was 18 deaths per 100,000 live births. That's up from 7.2 deaths per 100,000 live births
<br> in 1987. Research also shows racial disparities. From 2011 to 2014, the pregnancy-related mortality ratios for black 
<br>women were more than three times higher than for white women.</p>

<h2 style="color: green;">Some common postpartum complications include:</h2>
<li style="text-align:left; font-size:1.1em; color: red;">Postpartum hemorrhage: Excessive bleeding following childbirth.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left; font-size:1.1em; color: red;">Infections: Infections can occur in the uterus (endometritis), urinary 
tract (urinary tract infection), or surgical site <br>(wound infection) after a cesarean section. These infections can cause 
symptoms like fever, pain, and abnormal discharge.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left; font-size:1.1em; color: red;">Postpartum depression: A mood disorder characterized by feelings of 
sadness, anxiety, and exhaustion that<br> persist beyond the "baby blues" period. It can affect a woman's ability to care for 
herself and her baby.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left; font-size:1.1em; color: red;">Mastitis: Inflammation of the breast tissue, usually caused by a bacterial infection. It can lead to breast pain, swelling, redness,
<br> and flu-like symptoms.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left; font-size:1.1em; color: red;">Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Blood clots that can form in the legs (DVT) 
<br>and travel to the lungs (PE). These conditions can cause pain, swelling, and difficulty breathing.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left; font-size:1.1em; color: red;">Perineal tears: Tears or lacerations that occur in the perineum (the area between the vagina and anus) 
<br>during childbirth. The severity of tears can vary, ranging from minor to more extensive tears that 
<br>require repair.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left; font-size:1.1em; color: red;">Preeclampsia: A condition characterized by high blood pressure and organ damage, usually occurring
<br>after the 20th week of pregnancy. It can lead to complications such as seizures (eclampsia) and organ failure.</li>

<h2 style="color: green;">Prevention tips</h2>
<p>It is now recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that postpartum care be continuous 
<br>rather than limited to a single appointment following delivery. Make an appointment with your physician during the first three
<br>weeks following birth. See your healthcare physician for a thorough postpartum examination within 12 weeks of giving birth. 
<br>Speak with your provider if scheduling an appointment is becoming difficult for you. Ask your friends and relatives for assistance 
<br>with child care.</p>
<p>Your doctor will evaluate your emotional state and mood, talk about birth spacing and contraception, go over information regarding
<br>feeding and caring for your baby, ask about your sleep patterns and fatigue-related problems, and perform a physical examination 
<br>during this visit. This may involve examining your uterus, vagina, cervix, and abdomen to make sure you're recovering properly. You 
<br>should use this opportunity to discuss any worries you may have, such as starting up again or adjusting to life with a new child.</p>
<p>Additionally, make sure to mention the date of your delivery to each medical professional you meet in the year after childbirth. This
<br>can assist your healthcare professional in determining whether your symptoms are connected to your recent pregnancy.</p>
